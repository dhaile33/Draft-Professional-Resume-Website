              <h2>Dear HR manager,</h2>
              <p>
               It was delighting to come across the opening for the position of Data Scientist at Acorn Analytics. Having arrived at the end of my academic career in software engineering, I find this opportunity to be a great steppingstone to achieving my career ambitions and contributing to the success of a dynamic organization. I am confident that my acumen in data analytics will make me an asset to your team in strengthening business relationships to meet organizational goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the capacity of a data analyst at XYZ, I was responsible for creating data reports and monitoring, data entry, data auditing for accuracy. I also analyzing raw data, drew conclusions & developed relevant recommendations. Through carrying out specified data processing and statistical techniques, I developed strong problem solving and critical thinking abilities. I was also able to hone my leadership and interpersonal skills during this role within a collaborative environment. Working in fast-paced environments has enabled me to manage multiple timelines and projects paying attention to detail in an organized and efficient manner. Managing team projects for student organizations has given me excellent collaboration skills and commitment to building trusted professional relationships, both with coworkers and supervisors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Amassing thorough knowledge of data analytics has motivated me to transfer these skills to this position at Acorn and help clients make smarter decision making. I am confident that my professional skills and the yearning for Exploratory data analysis (EDA) would make me a great fit for this position. I look forward to discussing the possibility of joining the very successful organization of Acorn, with you.
              </p>
