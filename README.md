Daniel G Haile resume (Discription)
This web-based personal resume is a digital version of the traditional paper resume that contains my personal information,  educational, skills, projects, previous positions, and organizations I have worked on. 
The website has four main pages: a landing page, about, resume and projects, and an extra page containing my cover letter. The personal website resume also includes a download button on the resume page, allowing any visitor to download a pdf version of my resume. This is to serve me with an online home-based and build a personal brand that would make me a perfect first impression.
A few of the benefits of a web-based personal resume over the traditional resume include easy lookup online and supplements social media platforms. The other services include the easy update and easy access by any visitor or employer.
If I had enough time, I would include a back end system with a database that would request visitors and employees to provide their email address to be saved on the database and set up a chat system which would enable me to chat with anyone who wishes to acquire more information about me and my experience.
